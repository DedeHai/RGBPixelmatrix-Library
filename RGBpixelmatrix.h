/*
  RGBpixelmatrix.h - A library to handle WS2811 pixel based
 color matrix.
 Created by Damian Schneider, Jan. 27th, 2013.
 
 The library contains functions to write and read pixel colors,
 as well as a function to send pixels to hardware.
 Each pixel is represented by a 24bit RGB value (8bit per color).
 Maximum total number of pixels is 600 (ram limit). 
 Maximum width is 85, maximum length is 85. (can be increased by using 16bit integers to represent the width)
 
 Default autput pin is pin7, modify in sendByte function
 to change to different pin.
 
 Note: to keep the library fast, functions do not error check inputs.
 If you read or write pixels that are out of boundaries, random stuff 
 may happen.
